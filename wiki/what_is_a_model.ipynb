    "\n",
    "In all of these cases, probability is assigned to observations we are to make in the future. And it is something we assign, based on the *model* or belief of the world we have, or on the basis of past observations that we have made, or that we might even imagine that we would make.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider some additional examples. You might ask the probability of the Yankees winning the next baseball game against the Red Sox. Or you might ask for the probability of a launch failure for the next missile protecting Tel-Aviv. These are not academic questions: lots of betting money and lives depend upon them respectively. In both cases there is some past data, and some other inputs such as say, weather conditions, which might be used to construct a model, which is then used to predict the fate of the next game or launch.\n",
    "\n",
    "They key takeaway is this: for some reasons, and possibly using some data, we have constructed a model of the universe. In other words, we have combined **prior** beliefs and past frequencies respectively. This notion of such combination is yet another notion of probability, called the **Bayesian** notion of probability. And we can now use this model to make predictions, such us the future odds of a particular event happening."
