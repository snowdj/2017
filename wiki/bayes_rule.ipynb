    "## Bayes rule\n",
    "Bayes' Rule aka Bayes' Theorem is not controversial; it is two steps away from the definition of conditional probability, and it is extremely useful in all branches of statistics and probability becuase it lets us swap a variable that is in front of a bar with one that's behind a bar.\n",
    "\n",
    "More graphically, it lets us go from \"Probability of your test being positive, given that you have cancer\" to \"Probability of cancer, given that your test was positive\". If you've been keeping up, the second one should be much more personally interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Derivation\n",
    "Observe that \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ p(x,y) = p(y\\mid x) p(x) = P(x\\mid y)p(y).$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Given the product rule one can derive the Bayes rule, which plays a central role in a lot of the things we will be talking:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ p(y\\mid x) = \\frac{p(x\\mid y) \\, p(y) }{p(x)} = \\frac{p(x\\mid y) \\, p(y) }{\\sum_{y'} p(x,y')} = \\frac{p(x\\mid y) \\, p(y) }{\\sum_{y'} p(x\\mid y')p(y')}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Bayes Rule is just the first step. The other two are massaging p(x) in case we don't have the marginal readily available.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we only consider the events Y and Not Y, we can explicitly write out the sum:\n",
    "$$\\frac{p(x\\mid y) \\, p(y) }{p(x\\mid y)p(y)+p(x|y^-)p(y^-)}$$"

    "### Interpretation\n",
    "Bayes theorem, in general, consideres paths to the present. Taking Y to be \"cancer\" and X to be \"test positive\", the numerator is the path to having cancer and a positive test: first, you have to get cancer $P(Y)$ and then you have to test positve, given that you have cancer $P(X|Y)$. The terms in the denominator are the other paths to the observed data: in this case there is the above path, but also the path where you don't get cancer $P(X|Y^-)$ and then get a false-positive test $P(X|Y^-)$\n",
    "\n",
    "Even in complicated settings, Bayes is a matter of writing out all possible paths to the observed data. The probability of any particular path is the probability that it occurs divided by the probability of all paths to the observed data."

    "\n",
    ">Sally Clark, a lawyer who lost her first son at 11 weeks and her second at 8 weeks, was convicted in 1999. A prominent pediatrician, Sir Roy Meadow, had testified for the prosecution about Sudden Infant Death Syndrome, known as SIDS in the U.S. and cot death in Britain. Citing a government study, Meadow said the incidence of one SIDS death was one in 8,500 in a family like Clark’s–stable, affluent, nonsmoking, with a mother more than 26 years old.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Then, despite the fact that some families are predisposed to SIDS, Meadow assumed erroneously that each sibling’s death occurred independently of the other. Multiplying 8,500 by 8,500, he calculated that the chance of two children dying in a family like Sally Clark’s was so rare–one in 73 million–that they must have been murdered.\n",

    ">First, we look at natural causes of sudden infant death. The chance of one random infant dying from SIDS was about 1 in 1,300 during this period in Britain. Meadow’s argument was flawed and produced a much slimmer chance of natural death. The estimated odds of a second SIDS death in the same family was much larger, perhaps one in 100, because family members can share a common environmental or genetic propensity for SIDS.\n",
    "\n",
    ">Second, we turn to the hypothesis that the babies were murdered. Only about 30 children out of 650,000 annual births in England, Scotland, and Wales were known to have been murdered by their mothers. The number of double murders must be much lower, estimated as 10 times less likely.\n",
